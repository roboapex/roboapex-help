### Why isn't anyone replying to my issue?

#### Don't expect immediate responses

It will take time for your trainers to respond to questions, don't expect instant responses after submitting your questions. Your trainers try their best to help you, give them a bit of time

If your issue is urgent or has not been answered after an hour, you can label it as `urgent`

#### Check if it's a duplicate

If a similar question already exists, but isn't resolved yet, upvote or reply to it. This helps to prioritise which questions most people have and answer questions quickly

Avoid asking duplicate questions as much as possible

#### Provide Descriptive Questions

In order to make it easier your trainer to understand the question, try to provide them with the necessary. Here are some pointers you can keep in mind:

- What have you done it resolve it?

- Any screenshots/screen recordings?

- What change did you make that caused the problem? Maybe you clicked a button? Maybe you deleted a file?

- Which lesson is this question from? Or is it while you're experimenting and trying your own things out?

- Ensure that it's categorized properly, iOS questions should be categorised as iOS, Android questions should be categorized as Android.
